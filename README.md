# Porfolio
This portfolio's goal is to showcase my competency in analytics and data science. 

The projects are numbered in sequential learning order, 1 being the first project created using basic Python and ends in the most recently created, which focuses on data science techniques. 

You can quickly grasp what techniques are a focus for each project by looking at the end of each project's name, which has the technique or topic in brackets.

Note that these projects are not static, edits are made as my learning progresses and techniques become better understood.
