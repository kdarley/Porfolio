# Porfolio
This portfolio's goal is to showcase my competency in analytics and data science. 

The projects are numbered in sequential learning order, 1 being the first project created using basic Python and ends in the most recently created, which focuses on data science techniques. 

You can quickly grasp what techniques are a focus for each project by looking at the end of each project's name, which has the technique or topic in brackets.
